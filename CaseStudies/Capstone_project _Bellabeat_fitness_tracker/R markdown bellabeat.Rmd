## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

library(tidyverse)
library(readr)


dailyActivity_merged <- read_csv("dataset/mturkfitbit_export_3.12.16-4.11.16/Fitabase Data 3.12.16-4.11.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv")

sleepDay_merged <- read_csv("dataset/mturkfitbit_export_4.12.16-5.12.16/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv")

combined_data = merge(dailyActivity_merged,sleepDay_merged,by="Id")
longdata <- combined_data %>%
  select(contains("Minutes"), TotalTimeInBed) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -TotalTimeInBed,
    names_to = "ActivityType",
    values_to = "Minutes"
  )


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(longdata, aes(x = Minutes, y = TotalTimeInBed)) + 
      geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
      geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
      facet_wrap(~ ActivityType, scales = "free_x") +
      labs(title = "Relationship Between Activity Types and Sleep", x = "Active Minutes", y = "Total Time in Bed")


ggplot(data = combined_data, aes(x = Calories, y = TotalMinutesAsleep)) +
     geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
     geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
     labs(title = "Calories vs Sleep Duration",
          x = "Calories Burned",
          y = "Total Minutes Asleep")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the 



We conclude there exists no correlation between amount of steps walks or the intensity of the distance covered with the induviduals sleep.
